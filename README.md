Limits:
Common Lisp - Functional Programming
Odin - Procedural Programming
Prolog - Logic Programming
Java - Object Oriented Programming

To Java: i will most likely just use it for a single challenge, because i consider OOP to be a very useless paradigm.

### Day1:
Thought it was a cool challenge to do in FP. So i picked `Common Lisp`.
Initial hurdles were there, considering i cannot easily get in the FP mindset, but it turned out to be relatively neat
I think, i am improving when it comes to algorithmic challenges already, i tend to usually lay data out,
this time i was just purely interested on how to actually split up the task and solve it
